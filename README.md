# boardgame
This Flutter app is an attempt to use artificial intelligence to learn how to program in Flutter with help. It will be a board game with up to ten players in selected and differentiated colors, with the possibility of choosing to roll 1 to 3 dice and a total of 54 spaces covered in the game. First, I'll do it for Android. If I get it right, I'll do it for iOS too.
